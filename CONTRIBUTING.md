### Before you contribute
All contributions are licensed under the MIT license.
New contributors will be added to the AUTHORS file.
Please make sure you agree with that before submitting pull requests.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
me first through the issue tracker with your idea so that I may help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

use Github pull requests for this purpose.
